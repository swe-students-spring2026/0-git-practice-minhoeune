## Why is This Article Interesting?

One thing that caught my eyes about this article was that it was claiming that Agile development method is being killed by AI. I remember Professor Bloomberg teaching us about how Agile developement is a prominent method in software development, so I was intrigued at what the article was going to say. As I read further, I realized that the article isn't just dismissing Agile because of its ineffectiveness, but questioning its original values and what it means in a world of AI generated codes.

What I found most interesting about this article is how it pushes readers to reconsider software development methodologies as something that should be consistently changing to adapt to the world. Steve Jones argues that Agile was created to solve the problems of its time, and the rise of AI is going to introduce new sets of problems and priorities, such as verification of code (AI hallucinating, using older versions of the library). Rather than the "death" of Agile, I think Jones is urging the readers to rethink how Agile principles should and will evolve to remain relevant in today's world of agentic AI, to fit in an "Agentic SDLC".

### Kyle's Comment
I agree with Minho. The article's headline, "Agile is dead," is less about throwing Agile away and more about emphasizing that AI changes what teams should prioritize. If agents can generate lots of code quickly, then the bigger risk is no longer speed of implementation. It’s correctness and trust in the output. That's why Jones stresses verification. Things like catching hallucinations and noticing when the model suggests outdated libraries or patterns.

Minho also points out that methodologies need to evolve. Agile solved the problems of its time, but agentic workflows introduce new constraints. For example, teams may need clearer documentation of intent, stricter review and testing standards, and better "guardrails" around how the agent is used. In that sense, the article isn't really announcing the death of Agile. It's pushing us to adapt Agile practices so they still work in an agentic SDLC.
