# Article: *[AI killed the Agile Manifesto](https://medium.com/@jones.steveg/ai-killed-the-agile-manifesto-805ad9a639db)*

One thing that caught my eyes about this article was that it was claiming that Agile development method is being killed by AI. I remember Professor Bloomberg teaching us about how Agile developement is a prominent method in software development, so I was intrigued at what the article was going to say. As I read further, I realized that the article isn't just dismissing Agile because of its ineffectiveness, but questioning its original values and what it means in a world of AI generated codes.

What I found most interesting about this article is how it pushes readers to reconsider software development methodologies as something that should be consistently changing to adapt to the world. Steve Jones argues that Agile was created to solve the problems of its time, and the rise of AI is going to introduce new sets of problems and priorities, such as verification of code (AI hallucinating, using older versions of the library). Rather than the "death" of Agile, I think Jones is urging the readers to rethink how Agile principles should and will evolve to remain relevant in today's world of agentic AI, to fit in an "Agentic SDLC".
